# Notes
In any application, organizing and storing data in a way or in a 
structure that is best suited to its usage is key to efficient access 
and processing of data. 
There are some standard data structures that can be used to 
efficiently work with data. We can even customize them or build 
completely new ones to suit our application.

## Data structures: 
it represents the way of arrarning data in computer so that 
it can be accessed and used efficiently. 
It is all about grouping and storing collections of data in memory, 
opertaions that can be performed on 
these collections and algorithms that can be used for these operations.

### Data structure and its type: 
1. Liner data structure 
2. Non-Linear Data Structures  

1. linear data structures:
   a) arrays
   b) linked lists
   
2. non linear data structures:
   a) tree
   b) graphs
   c) hash table
   



lets have an example of grocery list of maria: 

list is a data structures to represent grocery items
# List: 
    1. it is linear data structure
    2. used to store sequence of values
    3. it may grow and shrink dynamically

Operations we can do on the list: 
   a) add
   b) insert
   c) delete
   d) display

Q.1 list implemenatation using array: 
what is an array: it is fixed capacity data structures and can store a collection of elements.
But we can use it for implementation of list of DS
